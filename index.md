## Hello, world!

I'm a research scientist and software developer at [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/).

I'm also a PhD student in the [Oxford Quantum Group](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/), supervised by [Aleks Kissinger](https://stringdiagram.com/) and [Bob Coecke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Coecke).
